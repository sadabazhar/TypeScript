# TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft.

`It's a superset of JavaScript`, which means it builds on top of JavaScript by adding new features. The main feature of TypeScript is its ability to add static types to your code. This helps catch errors early and makes your code more predictable and easier to debug.

## Here are a few key points about TypeScript:

Static Typing: You can define the types of variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps prevent bugs that might occur from type-related errors.

Compatibility: TypeScript code compiles down to plain JavaScript, so it can run anywhere JavaScript runs, like in web browsers and Node.js environments.

Tooling: TypeScript's type system improves the development experience with better code completion, navigation, and refactoring tools.

Modern JavaScript Features: TypeScript supports all the latest JavaScript features and even lets you use some features that are not yet standardized.

Community and Ecosystem: TypeScript has a strong community and is widely adopted in many popular projects and frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue.
