`It's a superset of JavaScript`, which means it builds on top of JavaScript by adding new features. The main feature of TypeScript is its ability to add static types to your code. This helps catch errors early and makes your code more predictable and easier to debug.

## TypeScript is compiled into JavaScript, which runs behind the scenes.

Therefore, TypeScript is a valuable development tool.
